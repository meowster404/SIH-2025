Student Central Dashboard (React + Tailwind)

This is a small demo project that provides three dashboards:

1) Student Dashboard
2) Faculty Dashboard
3) Institute Dashboard

It uses dummy data from `src/dummydata.js` and is built with Vite, React and Tailwind CSS.

Run locally (Windows PowerShell):

```powershell
# install dependencies
npm install

# start dev server
npm run dev
```

Files of interest:
- `src/dummydata.js` - dummy students, faculties and institutes
- `src/components/*` - dashboards and navbar

Notes:
- This is scaffolded as a minimal, self-contained example. After `npm install` the dev server should start and the dashboards will be available on the printed URL.
